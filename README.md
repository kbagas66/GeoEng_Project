This repository contains the documentation of one of my projects during the master's study. I created a GUI "SPT-Liq v1.0" to automatically perform calculations for liquefaction analysis based on soil investigation data.

***

SPT-Liq v1.0 was developed in order to provide a soil liquefaction assessment tool based on SPT-N data collected from the soil investigation. This software utilized several simplified methods for the liquefaction assessment. Besides, this software also provide the three-dimensional mapping of soil liquefaction hazard and physical properties by using linear interpolation method. The main functions of SPT-Liq v1.0 are:
1) Liquefaction assessment based on SPT-N data 
2) Three-dimensional mapping and visualization of the predicted liquefaction hazard and soil physical properties in the form of surface plot.
